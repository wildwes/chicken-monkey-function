// Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100.
//  But for multiples of five(5, 10, 15, etc.) print "Chicken" instead of the number and for the 
//  multiples of seven(7, 14, 21, etc.) print "Monkey".For numbers which are multiples of 
//  both five and seven print "ChickenMonkey".



// To determine if a number can be evenly divided by 5 or 7, use the JavaScript remainder operator.

// You can start with this simpler version that outputs even numbers to the console and ignores odd numbers.
// You need to refactor this code to meet the requirements above.
